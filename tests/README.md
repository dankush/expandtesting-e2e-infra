# Tests Module

## Goal
The `tests` folder houses all automated tests for the application, ensuring code quality and preventing regressions.

## Purpose
- **Quality Assurance**: Provides a systematic way to verify that the application is functioning as expected.
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensures that new code changes do not break existing functionality, maintaining application stability.
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation, demonstrating how the application is intended to be used and providing examples of expected behavior.

## Contents
- **conftest.py**: Pytest configuration file that defines fixtures and hooks used by all tests.
- **integration/**: Contains integration tests that verify the interaction between different components of the application.
- **e2e/**: End-to-end tests that simulate real user workflows, ensuring the application behaves as expected from a user's perspective.
- **component/**: Unit tests that focus on individual components in isolation, validating their functionality.
- **utils/**: Test-specific utility functions that assist in writing and organizing tests.
- **schemas/**: Contains JSON Schema validations to ensure data integrity and correctness in API responses.

This folder is essential for maintaining the quality and reliability of the application, providing a robust framework for testing various aspects of the codebase.
