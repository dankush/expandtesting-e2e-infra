# Agents Module

## Goal
The `agents` folder is designed to manage interactions with remote agents via SSH.

## Purpose
- **Remote Command Execution**: Provides functionality for executing commands on remote servers or devices, enabling automation of various tasks.
- **Log Retrieval and File Transfer**: Facilitates the retrieval of logs, transferring files, and managing processes on remote systems, which is essential for deployment, configuration, and monitoring.
- **Automation Support**: Supports automation workflows that involve deploying software, configuring servers, or monitoring remote systems, enhancing operational efficiency.

## Contents
- **ssh_client.py** (or **agent_executor.py**): Contains a class responsible for establishing SSH connections and executing commands on remote servers.
- **tasks/**: A subdirectory that defines specific automation tasks that can be executed via SSH, such as:
  - **deploy_app.py**: Automates the deployment of applications on remote servers.
  - **restart_server.py**: Provides functionality to restart remote servers.
  - **collect_logs.py**: Retrieves logs from remote machines for analysis.
- **credentials.yaml** (or another secure storage): Stores SSH credentials (hostnames, usernames, passwords/keys) securely and in an encrypted manner. It is recommended to use a secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault for sensitive information.

This folder is crucial for enabling seamless interactions with remote systems, allowing for efficient automation of tasks that require remote execution and management.
